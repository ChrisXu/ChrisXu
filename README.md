### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer who has been building beautiful iOS apps since 2011. I am also passionate about helping other engineers and shaping a healthier engineering culture.

* 🧑‍💻 I code in Swift by day, Python by night, and JS on weekend.
* 📚 I like reading books. [Here is my booklist](bit.ly/chrisxu-booklist).
* 📝 Occasionally, I write my thoughts on [Write The Func](https://chrisxu.wtf).
* ⭐️ Fun fact: The only novel I have is ***The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy***
